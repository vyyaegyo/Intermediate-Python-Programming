    "## Data structures in Python\n",
    "Built-in data structures in Python can be divided into two broad categories: mutable and immutable. Mutable (from Latin mutabilis, \"changeable\") data structures are those which we can modify -- for example, by adding, removing, or changing their elements. Python has three mutable data structures: lists, dictionaries, and sets. Immutable data structures, on the other hand, are those that we cannot modify after their creation. The only basic built-in immutable data structure in Python is a tuple."

    "### Lists\n",
    "Lists in Python are implemented as dynamic mutable arrays which hold an ordered collection of items.\n",
    "In Python, lists can contain heterogeneous data types and objects. For instance, integers, strings, and even functions can be stored within the same list. \n",
    "We can arbitrarily add, remove, and change elements in the list. For instance, the .append() method adds a new element to a list, and the .remove() method removes an element from a list.\n",
    "When creating a list, we do not have to specify in advance the number of elements it will contain.\n",
    "Thus, the pros of lists are:\n",
    "   They represent the easiest way to store a collection of related objects.\n",
    "   They are easy to modify by removing, adding, and changing elements.\n",
    "   They are useful for creating nested data structures, such as a list of lists/dictionaries.\n",
    "However, they also have cons:\n",
    "   They can be pretty slow when performing arithmetic operations on their elements. (For speed, use NumPy's arrays.)\n",
    "   They use more disk space because of their under-the-hood implementation."

    "### Dictionaries\n",
    "Dictionaries in Python are very similar to real-world dictionaries. These are mutable data structures that contain a collection of keys and, associated with them, values.\n",
    "We use dictionaries when we are able to associate (in technical terms, to map) a unique key to certain data, and we want to access that data very quickly (in constant time, no matter the dictionary size). Moreover, dictionary values can be pretty complex. For example, our keys can be customer names, and their personal data (values) can be dictionaries with the keys like \"Age,\" \"Hometown,\" etc.\n",
    "Thus, the pros of dictionaries are:\n",
    "\n",
    "They make code much easier to read if we need to generate key:value pairs. We can also do the same with a list of lists (where inner lists are pairs of \"keys\" and \"values\"), but this looks more complex and confusing.\n",
    "We can look up a certain value in a dictionary very quickly. Instead, with a list, we would have to read the list before we hit the required element. This difference grows drastically if we increase the number of elements.\n",
    "However, their cons are:\n",
    "\n",
    "They occupy a lot of space. If we need to handle a large amount of data, this is not the most suitable data structure.\n",
    "In Python 3.6.0 and later versions, dictionaries remember the order of element insertions. Keep that in mind to avoid compatibility issues when using the same code in different versions of Python.\n"

    "Sets in Python can be defined as mutable dynamic collections of immutable unique elements. The elements contained in a set must be immutable. Sets may seem very similar to lists, but in reality, they are very different.\n",
    "First, they may only contain unique elements, so no duplicates are allowed. Thus, sets can be used to remove duplicates from a list. Next, like sets in mathematics, they have unique operations which can be applied to them, such as set union, intersection, etc. Finally, they are very efficient in checking whether a specific element is contained in a set.\n",
